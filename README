WIP texture mapped software rasterizer

right now configured to load a "dog.obj" file and a "dog.tga" file from the data folder unless given a different command line file names.

to load a different obj model and texture do: "SoftwareTextureMapping.exe %obj_model_filename% %texture_filename%" or drag an OBJ model and texture into SoftwareTextureMapping.exe

the texture mapping is affine, the scale is made for the dog.obj model so other models will appear small
